Description: Tools for working with rotational data, including
    simulation from the most commonly used distributions on SO(3),
    methods for different Bayes, mean and median type estimators for
    the central orientation of a sample, confidence/credible
    regions for the central orientation based on those estimators and
    a novel visualization technique for rotation data.  Most recently,
    functions to identify potentially discordant (outlying) values
    have been added.
